I'm starting a Raytracer implementation using Vulkan as API.

For now, it's basically an implementation of Peter Shirley's book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" adapted to use glm (https://glm.g-truc.net/) and Vulkan. The Vulkan part is adapted from https://vulkan-tutorial.com/ .

Dependencies:
- glfw (included)
- glm (included)
- stb (included)
- tinyobjloader (included)
- VulkanSDK (not included, you can download from https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/)
